# pmdb

`pmdb` is a small command-line too that can be used to manage private messages
that were imported from a vBulletin forum via an XML file. The main purpose is
to keep private messages even if they have to be deleted in the vBulletin forum
due to limits of the forum instance. `pmdb` also offers the possibility to
generate HTML files for the messages from the XML files so that the messages can
be viewed locally almost as if they were still available on the forum instance.


Next, let's get to the [installation of pmdb](installation.md).
